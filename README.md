# simple delishows

### what?

I like to use [delishows](http://delishows.to) but I hate their new layout. This chrome extension simplifies it up, so I can _not_ illegally watch TV shows quicker.

This was made using [this](https://github.com/yeoman/generator-chrome-extension) yeoman generator.

Install it on the chrome app store [here](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/simple-delishows/jplgpplkjfagniiohaednfcmalpbecdk)
